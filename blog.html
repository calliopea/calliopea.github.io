<h2 class="heading-2"> First post!</h2>
<h5 class="date">2/4/2008</h5>

<p class="posts">Wow! I starteted a blog! No one said I would be able to do it! They told<br>
    me that I would never keep it updated. They said I would do 1 or 2 posts <br>
    before I got bored and would stop. Well look at me now! I have a blog!
</p>
<p class="posts"> "What's my blog going to be about?," you ask. It's going to be about <br>
    everything. I'll tell you all bout my greatest fears (snakes), my dreams, <br>
    my favorite things and all the things I wonder about. For example, what <br>
    would happen if a skeleton learned how to dance? Would  is be <em id="delight">delightful </em>
    or <strong id="terrifying">terrifying</strong>?
</p>

<h2 class="heading-2">Im back...</h2>
<h5 class="date">2/9/2018</h5>
<p class= "posts">Well it sure has been a long time since I posted last (just about a year. Or 10). <br>
    I remember how excited I was to start this and keep all of you guys <br>
    updated about my <em>exciting</em> life. Then I got bored so I stopped after <br>
    the first post. They said I'd do 2 posts before I, stopped but joke's on <br>
    them because I only did 1. Also, I found the answer to my question. It's<br>
    <strong id="scary">terrifying</strong>. Don't ask  how I found out.
