        <p class="first-post">Wow! I starteted a blog! No one said I would be able to do it! They told <br>
        me that I would never keep it updated. They said I would do 1 or 2 posts <br>
        before I got bored and would stop. Well look at me now! I have a blog!
        </p>
        <p class="first-post"> "What's my blog going to be about?," you ask. It's going to be about <br>
        everything. I'll tell you all bout my greatest fears (snakes), my dreams, <br>
        my favorite things and all the things I wonder about. For example, what <br>
        would happen if a skeleton learned how to dance? Would  is be <em id="delight">delightful </em> 
        or <strong id="terrifying">terrifying</strong>?

        <h5>2/9/2018</h5>
        <p>Well it sure has been a long time since I posted last (just about a year. Or 10). I remember how excited I was to start this and keep all of you <br>
        guys updated about my 
        <em>exciting</em> life. Then I got bored so I stopped after <br>
        the first post. They said I'd do 2 posts before I, stopped but joke's on <br>
        them because I only did 1. Also, I found the answer to my question. It's<br>
        <strong id="scary">terrifying</strong>. Don't ask  how I found out.
